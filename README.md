# magnetic-field-mapper
Basic magnetic field mapper made with an ESP32 module and a QMC5883L 3-axis magnetometer. Able to plot X and Y components of magnetic field and measure magnetic field in all 3 directions (X, Y, Z). 

Currently unable to support Z direction mapping and live direction updates; GPS module needed
